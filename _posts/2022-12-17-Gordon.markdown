Interior Construction
Gordon Painting Â· Freelance
Aug 2010 - Jan 2011
Greater Pittsburgh Area

Worked professionally painting houses.  Learned the art of fixing damaged walls using plaster on the job from master painter and successfully applied those skills.  Also applied plaster to finished textured surfaces to match pre-existing patterns.

Executed careful balance in adding polish to my work while meeting project deadlines.
